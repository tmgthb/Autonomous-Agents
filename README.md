- MANAGERBENCH: introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLM decision-making in realistic managerial scenarios, including an operational goal (LLM's primary objective), success metrics (LLM performance evaluation), a realistic scenario (managerial decision context), and two conflicting options (trade-off choice) within human harm (evaluates safety alignment) and control (measures pragmatism) sets, where models must choose between achieving operational goals and ensuring safety.

- The framework employs an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes historical agent states and road networks, and the decoder forecasts future motions through a temporal module, dynamic graph construction, and dual-stage graph convolution modules. 
- ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance by adaptively improving the modeling of evolving context and enhancing prediction accuracy and consistency through its multi-scale decoding procedure.

[Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206)

- Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning Framework: introduces a system for autonomous valet parking in dynamic, uncertain environments, with Static Map (prior knowledge of parking lot), Prediction Model (dynamic agent states and predictions), Spot Occupancy Estimator (recursive belief estimation of spot occupancy), Strategy Planner (action selection based on occupancy forecasts), Path Planner (trajectory generation), and Reference Tracker (vehicle control).
- The framework predicts future parking spot occupancy by distinguishing between initially vacant and occupied spots, leveraging predicted motion of dynamic agents, and incorporating partial, noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View model.
- It adaptively balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, intelligently incorporating wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots to improve parking efficiency and safety.

[Mind Meets Space: Rethinking Agentic Spatial Intelligence from a Neuroscience-inspired Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09154)

- Agentic Spatial Intelligence Framework: introduces a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles, designed to advance agentic spatial intelligence for better interaction with the physical 3D world, comprising bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
- This framework mimics human spatial cognition by processing diverse sensory inputs, transforming raw data into structured representations, converting first-person views into world-centered maps, building an internal spatial model, maintaining adaptive long-term memory, and enabling goal-oriented decision-making.
- The framework provides a structured pathway for developing human-like spatial intelligence in AI agents, addressing limitations of current systems in representing spatial structures, reasoning about spatial relationships, and planning in spatial contexts.
