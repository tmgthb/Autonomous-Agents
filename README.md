#### Why Autonomous Agents work?

This section includes important research papers establishig key concepts on the theory behind Autonomous Agents. 
The attempt is to build the following story:

1. LLMs is trained to predict next-word, but in fact leads to (massively) Multi-task learning (See here Jason Wei presentation illustrating this in more detail).
2. Data scaling leads to Emerging Abilities to perform increasing number of tasks with larger models compared to smaller ones.
3. Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning are examples of Self-Recursive Learning during Inference time with LLMs. = LLMs can be triggered to Self-Improve its outputs during Inference.
4. STaR is an example of Self-Recursive Learning by Fine-tuning LLMs using CoT-prompted reasoning. = LLMs can be triggered to Self-Improve its model weights by learning to Fine-tune using its outputs.
5. LLMs can be triggered to CoT in Tree/Graph-like structures.
6. Toolchaing* performs effective search of optimal CoT reasoning in a Tree-like structures and it manages to keep the computing time limited with A*-search algorithm.

[Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yzkSU5zdwD)

-  Defines officially the term  "Emergent Abilities": "An ability is emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models."
-  Emergent abilities were detected already with GPT-3, but here its clearly defined as ability detected only after specific scale.
-  Identifies a list of Emerging abilities not detected in specific smaller model, but identfied in a larger model.
-  I like the paper, because increasing number of task patterns are learned using single learning objective of next-word prediction as scale increases.

[STaR: Bootstrapping Reasoning With Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465)

- Introduces the concept: "Self-Taught Reasoner" (STaR) or *, where LLM improves its reasoning by learning from its own reasoning: model is asked to generate rationalizations to questions. If rationalization derives wrong answer to question, the rationalization is repeated by giving it as well the correct answer. All rationalizations leading to correct answer are used for fine-tuning the LLM model. This process is repeated and each iteration improves the LLMs capability of reasoning.
- The paper does not refer to Self-Recursive Learning, but we could argue it as an example of this process in the context of reasoning.

[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

- Defines Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
- CoT is one Emerging Ability not present in smaller models, but present in larger models.
- CoT can be seen as Self-Recursive Learning, where the LLM improves its own output by having LLM use intermediate steps to solve complex task.
- The approach effectively demonstrates the LLMs capability to perform Self-Recursive Learning, altough its not integrated back as training data of the model.

[Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)

- Applies first-time the term of LLMs ability to learn a task from contextual information: "In-Context Learning".
- This ability is another example of Self-Recursive Learning, altough its not integrated back as training data of the model.
- This paper as well identified the capability of LLMs to learn multiple tasks by having been only trained to predict the next word. See Jason Wei´s presentation included below, where he covers the "Massively Multi-task learning" of LLMs and I think it helps to gain better insight about LLMs, rather than thinking them as simply "statistical models".
