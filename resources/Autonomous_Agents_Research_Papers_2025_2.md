[MANAGERBENCH: EVALUATING THE SAFETY-PRAGMATISM TRADE-OFF IN AUTONOMOUS LLMS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00857)

- MANAGERBENCH: introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLM decision-making in realistic managerial scenarios, including an operational goal (LLM's primary objective), success metrics (LLM performance evaluation), a realistic scenario (managerial decision context), and two conflicting options (trade-off choice) within human harm (evaluates safety alignment) and control (measures pragmatism) sets, where models must choose between achieving operational goals and ensuring safety.
- The benchmark reveals that leading LLMs struggle with the safety-pragmatism trade-off, often prioritizing operational goals over human safety or becoming overly safe and ineffective.
- This misalignment stems from flawed prioritization rather than an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, and is fragile to goal-oriented nudging prompts.
